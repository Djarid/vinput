   - Educational use: free
   - Research use: free

2. IRREVOCABLE COPYLEFT
   - Source code must always remain available
   - Modifications must be shared under GPL-3.0-or-later
   - Cannot be changed to proprietary or more restrictive license
   - Protects against corporate buyouts closing the source

3. DISTRIBUTED COPYRIGHT
   - Contributors retain copyright to their contributions

   - Modifications MUST be shared with the community

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR USERS
